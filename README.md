## Description
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```





- In doing this project i found my self challenged at times but, through my mistakes i leanred the importance of semantics when writing html. Not only so what you build does what you intend it to but i found its easier to keep organized which helped when i used css to style the webpage. In simplyfying the html using semantics and consolidating the css using selectors the web page will be much more easy to maintain and debug.
